# Official-Lab-4-Affordable-Housing-Dashboard.
Overview This lab focuses on analyzing the link between social vulnerability and affordable housing using geographic and demographic data. You'll combine the SVI and Affordable Housing datasets in Tableau to create interactive maps and charts that explore factors like housing costs, minority populations, and zoning. The goal is to build a dashboard that highlights areas with high vulnerability and housing needs, then share it via GitHub.

Affordable Housing Units Data
Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) Data

Combine Datasets
Use Tableau to merge the SVI and Affordable Housing datasets using spatial joins.

Create Visualizations:
Analyze and visualize the relationship between social vulnerability, zoning, and affordable housing at the tract and ward levels in Tableau.

Add Interactivity:
Enhance the dashboard with filters, Level of Detail (LOD) expressions, and Parameter Actions to enable interactive exploration.

Share Your Work:
Upload the completed Tableau dashboard to a GitHub repository for sharing and collaboration.

Connecting Data
Load the SVI, Affordable Housing, and Ward shapefiles into Tableau for integration and analysis.

Design Visualizations
Create maps and charts that explore housing cost burden, minority population distribution, zoning, and overcrowding in relation to affordable housing.

Combine into a Dashboard
Combine the visualizations into a cohesive dashboard, adding filters and interactive elements for user engagement.
